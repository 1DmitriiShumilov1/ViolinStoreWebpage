# ViolinStoreWebpage

My second project. My mother is a violinist, so I decided to make a website dedicated to violins.

Includes 2 pages - company description, and a store with a shopping cart. JS code was copied from a YouTube channel Web Dev Simplified 
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeFzkC2awTM); however, I didn't just copy-paste the entire code, I adjusted it to fit with my html - changed the class names.
