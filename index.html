                <p>Hi, we are Brian and Bonnie Lee. We are holding our daughter Rose who was born 
                    in May of 2017 in front of Play Care Learning Center, which was under construction
                    at the time. It was an almost 4 year journey to get to that point but we are happy
                    we are providing the best early childhood education experience for children in the 
                    Sacramento area. Our passion, dedication and hard work have allowed us to make this 
                    dream a reality. We invite you to learn about our programs.

            <h1 class="pg-title">Philosophy</h1>
            <div class="pg">
                <p class="text-center">We are a Reggio Emilia inspired program. We don’t strictly follow the philosophy but adjust it to today’s realities with 
                    working parents. Reggio Emilia’s approach to learning is described as student-centered and project based utilizing self-directed, experiential 
                    learning in relationship-driven environments. It draws many similarities to Montessori such as mixed ages in classrooms, child focused and keeping 
                    students together as they progress but differs by being project focused and social skills oriented. Problem solving and conflict resolution 
                    are also key focus areas. Research has shown that social skills and problem solving skills are the most important indicator of future life 
                    success at this age. Many child development centers around the State have moved to this approach. We believe play is the work of children 
                    and is the basic way in which young children gain knowledge. Just as teachers use instructional techniques for reading, preschool teachers 
                    plan opportunities for spontaneous play, guided play, directed play, or investigative play to teach new skills and concepts. Our preschool 
                    program is designed to encourage learning through play, hands-on activities, and small and large group discovery time.

            <div class="pg">
                <p class="text-center">Play Care Learning Center is devoted to providing a loving, safe, supportive and educational environment for children ages six 
                    weeks to six years. We provide a home away from home where children are encouraged to develop their own intellectual, social, moral, emotional and 
                    physical skills. Our goal is to allow children to grow and develop their character in a meaningful way. The Play Care Learning Center staff is 
                    committed to the families we serve by providing value added services as well as support and encouragement for all involved.
